☀️/🌙 Toggle

## 🔍 Things I Had to Research
- How to inherit OS light/dark mode settings?
- How to handle the state of dark mode being on/off? How will the rest of the app know about this piece of state?
- How does the toggle look in Dropmark iOS? (note: I didn't see this in the app, is this in the current release? Regardless, just followed a standard toggle look)

## To Do
- [x] Build toggle component 
- [x] Adding state change on toggle
- [x] Adding styling change on toggle using Styled Components
- [ ] Edit default state based on OS setting
- [ ] Deploy :)
